# Neural Particle Playground

A wild, interactive 3D particle system with:

+ Floating neural particles that react to mouse movement

Glassmorphic Ul with neon accents

Multiple insane visual modes (galaxy, plasma, matrix rain, quantum mesh)

Audio reactivity (visualizer that dances to music)

Real-time particle physics with gravity & attraction

Fully responsive & works on mobile too WebGL-powered for crazy performance

Tech Stack:

React + Three.js (3D rendering)

Framer Motion (smooth animations)

TailwindCSS (gorgeous styling)

Vite (blazing fast build).
